1. Download the ICRL review dataset 2025
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papercopilot/paperlists/refs/heads/main/iclr/iclr2025.json

2. Utilize Arxiv API and download a sample of papers 50-250 from the dataset 
https://pypi.org/project/arxiv/

3. Use docling API to convert all the papers into a well structured dataset for docetl
(Alternatively you can use docetl.org playground and check)

4. Perform the following analysis with docetl

1. Divide all documents into manageable chunks 
2. Map all the topics per paper 
3. Map all the innovations introduced in the paper
4. Create a summary of each paper
5. Use the map operator again to detect relationships between entities, such as co-authorships or citations, within and across documents.
